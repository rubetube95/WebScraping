# WebScraping

Was messing around with Python and selenium to web scrape from Irish retailers. Goal is to central repository and search engine for all irish retailers to promote shop local in ireland this covid-19 Christmas. 

The code above is step 1 of 3. It'll help you to extract data and parse it to csv
Step 2 - storing it in on a scalable database
Step 3 - querying that data through a front-end search
